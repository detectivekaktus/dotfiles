# dotfiles
This repository contains all my personal dotfiles I use every day which are available to everyone!

Each separate directory should contain explanations to every choice in my configuration.

For xfce4 I used [Vimix theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Vimix-gtk-themes) and [Vimix icon theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/vimix-icon-theme)
